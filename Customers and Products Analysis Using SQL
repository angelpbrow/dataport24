Question 1: Which Products Should We Order More of or Less of?

WITH 
tab1 AS (
SELECT 
	p.productCode
FROM
	(
	SELECT
		p.productCode ,
		p.productName ,
		sum(o.quantityOrdered)/ p.quantityInStock as low_stock
	FROM
		products p
	JOIN orderdetails o ON
		p.productCode = o.productCode
	GROUP BY 
		p.productCode
	ORDER BY 
		low_stock DESC) p ),
tab2 AS (
SELECT 
	p.productCode
FROM
	(
	SELECT
		p.productCode ,p.productLine,
		p.productName,
		round(sum(o.quantityOrdered * o.priceEach),
		2) as product_performance
	FROM
		orderdetails o
	JOIN products p ON
		p.productCode = o.productCode
	GROUP BY 
		p.productCode
	ORDER BY 
		product_performance DESC
	LIMIT 10)p)
SELECT
	p.productCode, p.productName,p.productLine
FROM
	products p
WHERE
	p.productCode IN tab1
	AND p.productCode IN tab2;

Question 2: How Should We Match Marketing and Communication Strategies to Customer Behavior?

SELECT customerNumber, ROUND(SUM(quantityOrdered * (priceEach - buyPrice)),2) AS profit
FROM orders AS o
JOIN orderdetails AS d
ON o.orderNumber = d.orderNumber
JOIN products AS p
ON d.productCode = p.productCode
GROUP BY customerNumber
ORDER BY profit DESC;

Finding the VIP and Less Engaged Customers

--Top Five VIP customers
WITH AS cust_profits (
SELECT o.customerNumber, ROUND(SUM(quantityOrdered * (priceEach -              buyPrice)),2) AS profit
  FROM orders AS o
      JOIN orderdetails AS d
        ON o.orderNumber = d.orderNumber
      JOIN products AS p
        ON d.productCode = p.productCode
 GROUP BY customerNumber
 ORDER BY profit DESC
)


SELECT c.contactLastName ||' '|| c.contactFirstName, c.city, c.country, pr.profit
FROM customers AS c
JOIN cust_profits AS pr
ON pr.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
LIMIT 5;

--Five Least-engaged customers
WITH AS cust_profits (
SELECT o.customerNumber, ROUND(SUM(quantityOrdered * (priceEach - buyPrice)),2) AS profit
FROM orders AS o
JOIN orderdetails AS d
ON o.orderNumber = d.orderNumber
JOIN products AS p
ON d.productCode = p.productCode
GROUP BY customerNumber
ORDER BY profit ASC
)

SELECT c.contactLastName ||' '|| c.contactFirstName, c.city, c.country, pr.profit
FROM customers AS c
JOIN cust_profits AS pr
ON pr.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
LIMIT 5;

Question 3: How Much Can We Spend on Acquiring New Customers?
To determine how much money we can spend acquiring new customers, we can compute the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), 
which represents the average amount of money a customer generates. We can then determine how much we can spend on marketing.

--LTV of customers--
WITH cust_profits AS
(
SELECT o.customerNumber, ROUND(SUM(quantityOrdered * (priceEach - buyPrice)),2) AS profit
  FROM orders AS o
      JOIN orderdetails AS d
        ON o.orderNumber = d.orderNumber
      JOIN products AS p
        ON d.productCode = p.productCode
 GROUP BY customerNumber
 ORDER BY profit DESC
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(profit),2) AS LTV
  FROM cust_profits;
